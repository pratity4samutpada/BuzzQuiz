# BuzzQuiz
Which Chinese Warring States Period philosopher are you?
I focused on experimenting with DOM manipulation and creating a fully dynamic quiz. The programming itself is cumbersome and
inefficient, but I'm happy I just got the thing to work considering we haven't had much training with the DOM yet.
Things I would like to add or change:

1. Links to online resources about users' results.
2. Intro blurb on start page.
3. Smooth out transitions.
4. Add more graphics and graphic title to start.
5. Optimize the js so there are not as many repeated operations, explore ways of better structuring methods.
